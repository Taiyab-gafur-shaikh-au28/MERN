1. To create a real-time chat application using Node.js, React, Express, and Socket.IO. The application will have a web-based user interface built using React, which will allow users to interact with the chat functionality. Express will be used as the web framework to handle routing and API calls. Socket.IO will be used to handle real-time communication between the client and server. Node.js will be used as the runtime environment for the server-side of the application.

2. The application will allow users to create a username and join a chat room. Once in the chat room, users will be able to send and receive messages in real-time. The application will also have the ability to display a list of current users in the chat room.

3. Additionally, to improve the user experience, the application will have the ability to show notifications when a new user joins or leaves the chat room. The application will also have the ability to handle multiple chat rooms, and users will be able to switch between rooms.

4. The goal of this project is for create a functional, user-friendly chat application that utilizes real-time communication to provide a seamless experience for users. This project will also aim to provide a good understand and implementation of the technologies used like Node.js, React, Express, and Socket.IO.
